### Trouble shooting blank .vimrc file
I no experience with .vimrc files, so I asked gemini "how do i Add to your .vimrc file instructions to use Vundle and refer to plugins".

Gemini displayed a "starter code" that I was able to paste into my .vimrc with some default plugins that I replaced with plugins that I selected.

I ran the `vim +PluginInstall +qall` and it resulted in no errors.
